# Minterest chain node


# Building & Running MinterestChain


## Prerequisites

Ensure you have `llvm` and `clang` installed. On Ubuntu:

```bash
apt install -y llvm clang
```

## Building

### Rust Setup

Setup instructions for working with the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language can
be found at the
[Substrate Developer Hub](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started). Follow those
steps to install [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/) and configure the Rust toolchain to default to the
latest stable version.

Install Rust:

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Make sure you have `submodule.recurse` set to true to make life with submodule easier.

```bash
git config --global submodule.recurse true
```

### Makefile

This project uses a [Makefile](Makefile) to document helpful commands and make it easier to execute
them. Get started by running these [`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)
targets:


Install required tools:

```bash
make init
```

Build all native code:

```bash
make build
```

## Run

You can start a development chain with:

```bash
make run
```

## Development

To type check:

```bash
make check
```

To purge old chain data:

```bash
make purge
```

To purge old chain data and run

```bash
make restart
```

Update ORML

```bash
make update
```

__Note:__ All build command from Makefile are designed for local development purpose and hence have `SKIP_WASM_BUILD` enabled to speed up build time and use `--execution native` to only run use native execution mode.
